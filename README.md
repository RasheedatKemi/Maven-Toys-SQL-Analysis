# Maven Toys – SQL Sales & Inventory Analysis

This project analyzes sales and inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys.

Key questions:
- Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store 
locations? 
- How much money is tied up in inventory and how long will stock last?
- Are sales being lost due to out-of-stock products at certain locations?

Tools: SQL
